Problem text:

    There is a row of N stones, and there are bugs. Bugs don't like each other and edges of stone row.
    So when they come one by one they place themselves as far from other bugs and edges as possible. Bugs, that already sat on stone, won't move anywhere.
    Given number of stones and number of bugs, you need to find number of free stones to left and right from stone, which last bug sat on.

Solution to bugs and stones problem.

    chmod +x bin/console
    bin/console --stones 10 --bugs 4
    

Ouput:

    Array
    (
        [stones_left] => 1
        [stones_right] => 0
    )
